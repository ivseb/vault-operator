/**
 * SkillRegistryClient (FEAT-31-02)
 *
 * Fetches the public skill catalogue and installs a skill from it.
 *
 * The trust model in one line: a download tells us where a skill came from, not
 * that it is safe. An installed registry skill lands as `source: registry`,
 * which is a MANAGED tier (recorded and hash-pinned, so the badge is honest and
 * updates are detectable) but NOT a TRUSTED one. It runs through the same
 * approval chain as a skill the user wrote. See SkillProvenanceStore.
 *
 * What is verified before anything touches the vault:
 *   - the catalogue parses and every entry carries the fields we rely on
 *   - the download is under the size cap
 *   - the SHA-256 matches the catalogue entry
 * A failure at any of those steps writes nothing. Partial state is worse than
 * no state, because a half-written skill folder still loads.
 *
 * Network shape: exactly two GETs, both to the registry host, both triggered by
 * an explicit user click. Nothing is fetched on plugin load -- that would make
 * the plugin phone home on every boot, which the README promises it does not do.
